# Eye Movement

The objective of this project was to use JavaScript to bind code to user actions, in this case with the mouse. This was essential for creating the dynamic "eye" effect on this web page. Through this project, helps to better understand how coding can be used to create a unique and interactive user experience.

##*Important highlights:*##

**index.html** - Calls eyes.js and styles.css files.
**eyes.js** - works with the ball div id and follows the mouse movement by calling the event.clientX and event.clientX


**styles.css** - add styles to the eyes and eyes-balls


---
##*Where to go from here:*##

- It will be nice to dynamically generate sets of eyes  by pushing an "add set of eyes" button
